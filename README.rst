Microvascular remodeling
------------------------

For a full_plus_ladder perfusion mesh, use the Python binding
``evaluate_prq_micro(mesh_type, vessel_type, grav_dirn, grav_factor,
bc_type, inlet_bc, outlet_bc, remodeling_grade, remodeling_side)``
from ``aether.pressure_resistance_flow``. ``remodeling_side`` is
``"arterial"``, ``"venous"``, or ``"both"``. Grade zero leaves both sides
healthy. The existing ``evaluate_prq`` call remains available and uses the
arterial ladder side when its grade is positive.

For wave simulations, ``aether.wave_transmission`` exposes
``evaluate_wave_transmission_micro`` with the same arguments as
``evaluate_wave_transmission`` and an additional final ``remodeling_side``.
Use the same grade and side in both calls.

Selection uses the healthy nominal vessel diameter within each ladder unit.
Hypertrophy affects 100-1000 micrometres; narrowing affects 30-300
micrometres; fibrosis affects 30-500 micrometres; and effective pruning
affects diameters below 300 micrometres (below 500 from grade 50). The symmetric ladder represents
pruning as a fractional loss of parallel vessels, rather than individual
occlusions. The ninth generation contains capillary sheets only, so tubular
arteriole and venule remodeling applies to generations 1-8. The capillary
sheets themselves are unchanged.
